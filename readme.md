# PalleteForge - Simple Android Application

This repository is made for a college project and obviously is **NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE**.

To anyone who wonders what this is about, It's a basic android application which 
- Lets the user create a Color Palette.
- Color Palette may contain 2 to 4 colors.
- Can select the colors in any of the following format
  - RGB
  - HSV
  - HEX
- Can give a label to the Palette,

and finally save it.

The app uses SharedPreferences to save the Palette Data.

**This application was made by a _Rookie_ programmer so it is bound to have numerous flaws. No clean architecture techniques were adopted.**

**To anyone who wants to use the project, I've made this is Android Studio Electric Eel Patch 2.**
